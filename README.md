This project is a simple command-line application designed to help library staff manage their book collection efficiently. It is built using Python and follows object-oriented programming principles.The system allows users to add books, issue and return them, and search the catalog by title or ISBN. It saves the book records in a JSON file, ensuring data is saved permanently and loaded whenever the program runs.This project strengthens understanding of key programming concepts like classes, file handling, and user input, and provides a practical solution for managing library inventories in a small or medium-sized setup.
