## Project Description

This project is a simple command-line application designed to help library staff manage their book collection efficiently. It is built using Python and follows object-oriented programming principles.

The system allows users to add books, issue and return them, and search the catalog by title or ISBN. It saves the book records in a JSON file, ensuring data is saved permanently and loaded whenever the program runs.

This project strengthens understanding of key programming concepts like classes, file handling, and user input, and provides a practical solution for managing library inventories in a small or medium-sized setup.

## Code Explanation

### Book Class
The `Book` class represents an individual book with the following:
- **Attributes:** title, author, isbn, status (available/issued)
- **Methods:**
  - `__init__()`: Initialize a book with details
  - `__str__()`: Display book information as a string
  - `to_dict()`: Convert book object to dictionary for JSON storage
  - `issue()`: Mark a book as issued
  - `return_book()`: Mark a book as available
  - `is_available()`: Check if book is available

### LibraryInventory Class
The `LibraryInventory` class manages the collection of books:
- **Attributes:** filename (JSON file path), books (list of Book objects)
- **Methods:**
  - `add_book()`: Add new book to inventory
  - `search_by_title()`: Search books by title
  - `search_by_isbn()`: Search books by ISBN
  - `display_all()`: Display all books in inventory
  - `save_books()`: Save books to JSON file
  - `load_books()`: Load books from JSON file

### Main Menu Function
Provides a user-friendly command-line interface with 7 options for users to interact with the library system.

---

## How to Run

1. Save the code as `library_manager.py`
2. Open command prompt or terminal
3. Navigate to the folder where you saved the file
4. Run: `python library_manager.py`
5. Follow the menu options to add, issue, return, or search books

---

## Features Implemented

- ✅ **Object-Oriented Design** - Two well-designed classes with clear responsibilities
- ✅ **Book Management** - Add, issue, return, and track book status
- ✅ **Search Functionality** - Search by title (partial match) and ISBN (exact match)
- ✅ **JSON File Handling** - Persistent storage with automatic load/save
- ✅ **Exception Handling** - Proper error handling for file operations
- ✅ **Menu-Driven Interface** - Simple and intuitive CLI for users
- ✅ **Data Persistence** - Data saved between program runs
- ✅ **Status Management** - Track available and issued books

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

1. **Encapsulation** - Book class encapsulates book data and behaviors
2. **Data Abstraction** - Complex operations hidden from user
3. **File I/O** - Reading and writing JSON files
4. **Exception Handling** - Try-except blocks for error management
5. **List Operations** - Searching and managing lists of objects
6. **User Input** - Interactive menu-driven interface

---

## Conclusion

This Library Inventory Manager project successfully demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles in creating a practical, functional tool. The system efficiently manages library operations while maintaining data persistence and providing an intuitive user interface. The code is modular, maintainable, and can be easily extended with additional features like book ratings, due dates, or user authentication.
